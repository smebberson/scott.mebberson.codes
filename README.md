See [Hosting](#hosting) for more information.

## Hosting

This website is hosted entirely on GitHub Pages, fronted by the awesome Varnish Cache. It works like this:

-   The `out` directory is a [Git Worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) aliased to the `gh-pages` branch.
-   Some GitHub Actions will build and export a new version of the website.
-   A final GitHub Action will commit the contents of the out directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

This results in GitHub publishing the last version of the website ðŸŒ®.
