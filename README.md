# scott.mebberson.codes

Source code and content for my scott.mebberson.codes website.

## Usage

### First time setup

- Clone this repository.
- Execute `yarn` to install dependencies.

### Development

To develop the website (including authoring content):

- Execute `yarn dev`.
- Visit http://localhost:4040.

If you'd like to test the production version:

- Execute `yarn build && yarn export`.
- Execute `yarn serve`.
- Visit http://localhost:4040.

### Content

To add more content, follow the steps for development, then:

- Add an entry to `posts.js`.
- Create a page in `pages/post` with the same name as the `slug` from `posts.js`.
- Author the page as required.

## Publishing

To publish new content simply push to `master`. The GitHub Actions within this repository will kick-in and build, export and commit on the `gh-pages` branch.

See [GitHub Actions](#github-actions) and [Hosting](#hosting) for more information.

## GitHub Actions

To develop and test the GitHub Actions, do the following:

- Execute `rm -rf ./next` to remove the `.next` directory.
- Execute `rm -rf ./node_modules` to remove the `node_modules` directory.
- Execute `yarn workflow:step:setup` to build `node_modules` in the context of Linux.
- Execute `yarn workflow` to run the entire workflow (other than the setup step).

You need to execute `yarn workflow:step:setup` to ensure `node_modules` is setup within the environment that will use them in subsequent steps (i.e. Alpine Linux).

When you're finished developing the GitHub Actions, do the following:

- Execute `rm -rf ./node_modules`.
- Execute `yarn` to build `node_modules` in the context of your host.

## Hosting

This website is hosted entirely on GitHub Pages, fronted by the awesome Varnish Cache. It works like this:

- The `out` directory is a [Git Worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) aliased to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Some GitHub Actions will build and export a new version of the website.
- A final GitHub Action will commit the contents of the out directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

This results in GitHub publishing the last version of the website ðŸŒ®.
